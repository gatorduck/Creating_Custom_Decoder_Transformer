My motivation is inspired by current large language models trained on sequences of tokens representing natural language. In this case, each diagnosis code (like an ICD-10 code) is treated as a token in a sequence, just like a word in a sentence. But instead of natural language, the sequence represents a patientâ€™s chronological medical history. The goal of this custom decoder is to learn temporal patterns or predict future diagnoses. This is far from comprehensive or obtained but created to inspire. Other ideas I intend to test include applying this to an agentic system, and training other inputs along with diangosis codes, such as non-medical drivers of health.
